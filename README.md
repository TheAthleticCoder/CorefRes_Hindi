## **Introduction:**

Coreference resolution is the task of finding mentions which refer to the same real-world entity. Although coreference resolution is a very important and common task in NLP, most of the previous work in it has been towards hand crafted features. Along with that, most of the work in coreference resolution has been in English, with little to none work for Hindi. In this work, we explore neural-network based methods on English and Hindi datasets. We also try to leverage BERT to produce contextual word embeddings which boost the performance of the models. We also create a baseline model for neural coreference resolution in Hindi.
